This is a project to create Bee Awareness. The problem of decline in bee colonies is escalating and it is high time to create awareness about this issue. This project involves the use of libraries like Pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn for extensive data visualization. Data has been taken from United States Department of Agriculture. It is a subset of original data provided and a lot cleaner version. Some of the starting goals of this project were to answer following questions:-
<li> Reason for the decline of bee population in past years.</li>
<li> Impact on bees in various states.</li>
<li> Year wise analysis.</li>
<li> States with highest decline in bee colonies and Why? </li>
<br>
After examining this data and penning down some important points a detailed research was done using available resources on internet. We collected all the important points, interesting facts and backed these things using our data and published a website to create Bee Awareness.
